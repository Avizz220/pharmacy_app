# Image Setup Instructions

To complete the login page background setup, please follow these steps:

## Step 1: Save the Pharmacy Pills Image
1. Save the pharmacy pills image (from your attachment) as "pharmacy-pills-bg.jpg"
2. Place it in the public folder: `pharmacy_app/public/pharmacy-pills-bg.jpg`

## Step 2: Verify the Setup
The image will be used as a background for the right side of the login page, with a blue gradient overlay to maintain text readability.

## File Location
- Path: `pharmacy_app/public/pharmacy-pills-bg.jpg`
- The CSS has been updated to reference this image path: `url('/pharmacy-pills-bg.jpg')`

## What's been implemented:
- ✅ Updated Login.css to include the image as background
- ✅ Added proper background sizing and positioning (`cover`, `center`)
- ✅ Maintained the blue gradient overlay for text readability
- ✅ Added subtle visual enhancements with radial gradient overlay
- ✅ Fixed z-index layering to ensure content displays properly
- ✅ Added smooth transitions for better user experience

## Visual Features Added:
- **Background Image**: Pharmacy pills image as the main background
- **Gradient Overlay**: Blue gradient (85% opacity) for text readability
- **Radial Highlight**: Subtle light effect for visual depth
- **Fixed Attachment**: Background stays in place during scrolling
- **Responsive Design**: Image scales properly on all screen sizes

## Testing
Once you place the image file:
1. Navigate to the login page
2. The right side should display the pharmacy pills background
3. The "Crystal Pharmacy" branding and feature cards should be clearly visible over the background
4. The background should maintain its position and scaling

## Fallback
If the image doesn't load immediately, the page will fall back to the blue gradient background until the image is properly placed.
